# matlab-scripts

This repository serves mainly as a backup of all matlab scripts that I have created/used in my courses and projects in university.

I am working on pushing all scripts I have made in the past, and improving them as I learn more.
I plan to implement most of these scripts into C++, both for practice and so that I will be able to integrate them into projects in the future.
